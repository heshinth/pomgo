# PONGO a pong game made in Scratch

This is Scratch project made for [**CS50x**][1]

It is a simple pong game. A ball is bouncing all around, and we control the paddle to prevent the ball from falling down. We control the paddle using the mouse as input. The speed of the ball increases with every 10 points. The game ends when the ball falls to the bottom.

This is the Scratch project after converting it into HTML and hosted using Github pages

I used [**TurboWarp**][2] to convert the sb3 file to a zip file for the website and hosted using Github pages

The game can be accessed [**here**][3]
